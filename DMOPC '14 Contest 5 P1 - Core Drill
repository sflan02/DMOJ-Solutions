#Simon got a new drill recently. Everyone knows that a drill is shaped like a right circular cone. 
#Simon knows his drill has radius  and height . But now he wants to calculate the volume. Write a program to help Simon!

PI= 3.14159
r=int(input())
h=int(input())
#(Ï€r^2h)/3
v=(PI*(r*r)*h)/3
print(v)
