#After seeing the first problem, you are probably very angry at the fact that you wasted a lot of time reading. For this problem, 
#you should just count the number of words you have to read in a text. 
#That's it. No tricks, no hidden catches. For the purposes of this problem, a word is any maximal contiguous group of non-whitespace characters.

t=input()
s = t.split()
print(len(s))
