#Late October can be a rather frightening time of year. 
#Night begins to fall ever earlier, ancient Pagan rituals make demons stir, and at the end of the month, hordes of small creatures can even be seen 
#roaming the streets! It's a spooky sight if there ever was one.
#But just how spooky is this demonic festival? Its spookiness level can, in fact, be measured and represented as a single integer. 
#However, a simple number doesn't truly do the spooky sensation justice. As such, it can also be described with the word spoo...ooky, with exactly  o's.
#Given the integer , can you cast a spooky incantation on your computer to have it produce the corresponding spooky word?

r =input()
s = int(r)
